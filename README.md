# dotfiles
My dotfiles for ZSH(and [Oh-My-ZSH](https://ohmyz.sh/) themes and such), [terminator](https://gnome-terminator.org/), [fusuma](https://github.com/iberianpig/fusuma), and Tmux.

This uses fswatch to watch files for changes and automatically commit them there. Though this is disabled when I am testing of course. :P Always nice to have a backup.
