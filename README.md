# dotfiles
My dotfiles for ZSH(and [Oh-My-ZSH](https://ohmyz.sh/) themes and such), Vim, and Tmux. I have a backup for a file to import keyboard shortcuts for [Flameshot](https://flameshot.org/) into KDE as well.

This works for me after installing powerline font and mscorefonts as well(Since I use ubuntu it's as simple as `sudo apt install -y fonts-powerline ttf-mscorefonts-installer`) for the [Power10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k) theme for Oh-My-ZSH.
